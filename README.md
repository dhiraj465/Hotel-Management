# Hotel Management OOP Project

This is a Hotel Management tool developed using Object-Oriented Programming principles. It allows users to manage activities such as storing customer details, booking rooms of four different types, ordering food for particular rooms, unbooking rooms, and generating bills. The program also provides information about room features and availability. 

## Features

- Menu-driven program that runs until the user exits.
- Uses file handling to store customer details, booked rooms, and food orders. The program reads the file when it restarts to retain the previous status of the hotel.
- Uses multithreading to write the file in a separate thread for parallel execution.
- Uses user-defined exception to handle cases where a user tries to book an already allotted room.
- Properly handles unexpected exceptions using exception handling.
